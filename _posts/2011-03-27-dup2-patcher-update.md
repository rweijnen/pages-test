A missing feature in the dUP2 Patch Generator has always been to correct the PE Checksum.

After all if you write a clever search&amp;replace patch but have to include the PE Checksum it doesn’t make any sense.

But then I saw there’s a beta version of dUP2 that supports ome new features one of them being a fix checksum option!

The beta (v2.22) can be found on diablo2oo2’s site: <http://diablo2oo2.di.funpic.de/stuff/dup2.beta.rar>
