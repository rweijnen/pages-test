If you are looking for the HP Simple SAN Connection Manager Software (aka HP SSCM) then you’ve come to the right place. HP seems to be really good at hiding their software on the web but I found it.

Go to <http://www.software.hp.com/kiosk> and user the following credentials to access:

> username: SSCM\_3X\_KIOSK  
> password: s3\*S#M1$

Then you can download by clicking Receive for Free.

**EDIT**: I also found a direct link on [HP’s FTP Server](ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software11/COL24259/co-84381-1/5697-0434.zip)
