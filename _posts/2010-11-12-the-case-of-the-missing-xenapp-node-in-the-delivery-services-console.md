After having successfully tested the Unattended install jobs for my Citrix XenApp 5 environment I went on to testing the install.

The install itsself and the msi logs that my jobs created all indicated that the install was successfull.

So I went on and launched the install jop for the Delivery Services Console. This job succeeded nicely but when I opened the console the XenApp node was missing:

[![XenApp](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/xenapp-small.png)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/xenapp.png)

The resolution is described in [CTX125827](http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX125827 "Presentation Server or XenApp Nodes are Missing in the Access Management Console or Delivery Services Console") but Resolution 2 is a lot of manual labour üôÅ

So what do we do? We script it!
