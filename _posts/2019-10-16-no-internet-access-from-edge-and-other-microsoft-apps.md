I had a strange issue today: I couldn‚Äôt open any webpage in the Edge browser on my Windows 10 machine:

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Edge browser with error message "Can't reach this page"](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image.png)<figcaption>Edge browser: ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt reach this page‚Äù</figcaption></figure><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft">![Network icon showing Internet access](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-1.png)</figure></div>The network icon was showing that there was Internet access and a quick check on the command prompt showed that the connection (including name resolution appeared to work fine):

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Internet Explorer showing the "Welcome to the web" page:
You should try Microsoft Edge


The newest browser from Microsoft for Windows 10




The same people who brought you Internet Explorer proudly bring you Microsoft Edge. It builds on the Internet Explorer browser you trust and lets you take along all your favorites. Plus you can:



‚Ä¢Write on web pages 
‚Ä¢Read without distractions 
‚Ä¢Get instant search results 

Go beyond browsing with Microsoft Edge 

TRY MICROSOFT EDGE NOW ](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-5.png)<figcaption>Internet Explorer works fine</figcaption></figure>Ironically Internet Explorer recommends to use Edge üòÇ

I then noticed that my internet connection was marked as ‚ÄúPublic network‚Äù even though I am sure that it was previously set to ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù:

<figure class="wp-block-image">![Network Status showing the network is marked as a Public network](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-6.png)<figcaption>Network Status</figcaption></figure>When I switched the network to Private, Edge immediately loaded the page and the Outlook splash screen disappeared and it‚Äôs main window popped up.

Unfortunately I do not have an explanation (yet) for this strange error, I can only say it happened after updating VMware Workstation which may or may note have anything to do with it.

EDIT: 18-10-2019: Switched back to Public profile and everything stays working including Edge and Outlook.

I‚Äôll update this post if/when I find out more‚Ä¶
