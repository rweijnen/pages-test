Today I reused a unit I wrote a long time ago for TSAdminEx that shows Resource Dialogs from DLLâ€™s or Executables. I wrote it for a couple of reasons:

- Reusing existing dialogs is conventient since the user already knows it.
- Windows takes care of translating it into the userâ€™s language.
- I am too lazy to recreate them ðŸ˜‰

The code is hardly rocket science and could probably be improved and made more sophisticated but it works for me. I decided to share it since you may find it usefull.

Here is a small usage example that shows the Reset Password dialog from Active Directory Users &amp; Computers. This dialog is in dsadmin.dll (on Windows Vista/7 you will find it in ds.admin.dll.mui in the language subfolder eg %systemroot%\\system32\\en-US but you can load it using just the dll name).

It looks like this:  
â€œ&gt;  
The code to display it in Delphi looks like this:  
â€œ&gt;  
The Constructor takes the following parameters:

- Parent Window Handle
- DLL or Exe name
- Dialog Resource Id
- Optional: A procedure that is called before displaying the dialog where you can init the controls.

My init procedure looks like this:  
â€œ&gt;

Have fun with it and if you improve something please let me know!
