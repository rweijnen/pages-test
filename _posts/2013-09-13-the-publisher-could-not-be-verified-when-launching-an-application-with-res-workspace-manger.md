Today I was troubleshooting a warning message that popped up when launching a network application with RES Workspace Manager:

[![The publisher could not be verified. Are you sure you want to run this software?](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image_thumb.png "Open file - Security Warning")](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image.png)

Usually this is a simple fix: add the servername (<file://server>) to the Local Intranet zone:

[![You can add and remove websites from this zone. All websites in this zone will use the zone's security settings.](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/clip_image002_thumb.jpg "Local intranet")](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/clip_image002.jpg)

That worked when I launched the application directly. However when launching the application with RES Workspace Manager I would still get the warning. Even stranger: when I clicked Cancel the application would still be launched.

This problem seems related to the way Workspace Manager launches an applications: the programâ€™s path is replaced with %respfdir%\\pwrgate.exe &lt;appid&gt;.

A trace with Process Monitor showed that the ZoneMap was not even checked. That leaves us with two options to fix it:

**<u>Option #1:</u> Change Security Settings for the Internet Zone** An easy way to get rid of this message is to allow Launching applications and unsafe files in the Internet Security Zone:

[![Launching applications and unsafe file (not secure)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/clip_image0025_thumb1.jpg "Security Settings - Internet Zone")](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/clip_image0025.jpg)

Internet Explorer warns us right away that this is a bad idea:

[![Are you sure you want to change the settings for this zone? | The current security settings will put your computer at risk.](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013_09_13_15_14_45_Desktop_spvw9050_Citrix_Receiver_thumb.png "Warning!")](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013_09_13_15_14_45_Desktop_spvw9050_Citrix_Receiver.png)

**<u>Option #2:</u> Change Attachment Manager Policy**   
This option is less worse than option #1 but another solution is preferred. As a workaround it will do though.

Open the Managed Application and create a new User Registry Policy under Configuration. Import *AttachmentManager.admx* (usually in C:\\Windows\\PolicyDefintions).

Include .exe in the "Inclusion list for moderate risk file types":

[![Attachment Manager | Inclusion list for moderate risk file types](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/clip_image0027_thumb.jpg "User Registry Policy")](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/clip_image0027.jpg)
