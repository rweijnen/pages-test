I am working on an Customer Management Console that will present all adminstrative tasks that customers will need in their environment in a single console.

It will handle Active Directory, Terminal Server and Citrix, Printers and will offer specific Views and Reporting. For the Active Directory stuff I decided to create some classes that enabled me to work with AD in a more Delphi OOP way.

In a series of Blog Posts I will write about interesting things or just random notes that I made while creating this stuff. The intention is to publish the whole unit in the [Jedi Security Library](http://blog.delphi-jedi.net/security-library/) when itâ€™s finished.

Well I hope you that youâ€™ll find some things of interest ðŸ˜‰
