Today I received an e-mail from Softpedia telling me that they have [listed](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Remote-Utils/Launch-RDP.shtml) one of my commandline tools, LaunchRDP. I don’t know how they found or why they think that it should be listed, but it’s nice to see that they respect the author and informed me. If you want to rate it, [here’s](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Remote-Utils/Launch-RDP.shtml) your chance!
