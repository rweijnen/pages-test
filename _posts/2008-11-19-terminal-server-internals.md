Hello, my name is Danila Galimov and i will write here sometimes ðŸ™‚

My first post is about communications between Terminal Server sessions and Terminal Server service process (termsrv.exe/dll). Terminal Server service needs to communicate with each session for many tasks, such as sending window message, getting message reply and so on. So, on init, Terminal Server creates a **SmSsWinStationApiPort** port in global namespace and runs a few WinStationLpcThread threads, which are listening on port and are used to process port messages. When csrss.exe is started, it parses its command line, which usually looks like:

> %SystemRoot%\\system32\\csrss.exe ObjectDirectory=\\Windows SharedSection=4096,4096,1024 Windows=On SubSystemType=Windows ServerDll=basesrv,1 ServerDll=**winsrv***:UserServerDllInitialization,3 ServerDll*=winsrv:*ConServerDllInitialization,2 ProfileControl=Off MaxRequestThreads=16*

and loads the required dlls (winsrv.dll in our case). Initialization of winsrv.dll creates a thread, which connects to **SmSsWinStationApiPort** port and does the loop for processing Terminal Server messages until it receives WinStationTerminate message.

Weâ€™ll try to fool Terminal Server and send some messages to the port directly. At first, we need to connect to the port. A structure of 3 DWORDS is used to for connection:  
â€œ&gt;  
Letâ€™s do the connection:  
â€œ&gt;  
Now weâ€™re connected. We need to prepare and send a message. Each message (after standard PORT\_MESSAGE header) has common header:  
â€œ&gt;  
For creating idle winstation, 2 fields are added to this message: WinstationName, which is optional, and OutSessionId, which returns, on success, id of recently created winstation. So the whole structure will look like this:  
â€œ&gt;  
So now we can send this message and check for the results:  
â€œ&gt;  
Disconnect and Reset (logoff messages) are very simple: just target session id is added to the structure.  
â€œ&gt;  
Thatâ€™s all! Now we can just add command line parameters parsing features, and itâ€™s ready for usage!

As only system is allowed to access SmSsWinStationApiPort port, we need to run our program as system. You can use **[RunAsSys](http://blog.delphi-jedi.net/2008/05/08/runassys-10-preview/)** program for that propose.

Unfortunately, in windows vista/2008 the Terminal Server internal functions have been changed, so this program (IdleWinsta) does not work on vista.
