**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background  
</span>**Customer uses Citrix XenApp 5 with ThinApp, RES Workspace Manager and RES Workspace Extender.

An application integration strategy is defined, the picture below displays the strategy and preferred order:

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span>**  
Customer wanted to know the type (1..7) for all applications currently defined in RES Workspace Manager.

I decided to export all the Applications from RES WM as Building Blocks. This results in a folder with XML files. I decided to parse the XML files with a PowerShell script.

The scripts display a progress bar while running, indicating the current Building Block and percentage complete:

When the script is finished a Save File Dialog pops up so you can save the CSV file:

And the resulting Excel Sheet:
