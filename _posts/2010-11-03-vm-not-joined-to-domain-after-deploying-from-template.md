As I wrote earlier today I am provisioning Virtual Machines with PowerCLI. I donâ€™t know if this is intentional behaviour but after Deploying (Cloning) a Virtual Machine from a template the Network Adapter is not automatically connected at power on.

This made the Join Domain operation which is party of the Customization Specification to fail. I noticed this in the log file which can be found in %WINDIR%\\Temp\\vmware-imc\\guestcust.log:

> Joining domain mydomain using account mydomain\\myaccount and password â€˜\*\*\*\*\*â€™  
> The specified domain either does not exist or could not be contacted.

So I wrote a small fix script in PowerCLI:

â€œ&gt;  
And of course I changed the Provisioning script to do this as well ðŸ˜€
