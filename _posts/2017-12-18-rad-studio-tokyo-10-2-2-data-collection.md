Just a very quick note: I was just installing RAD Studio 10.2.2 when I noticed the installer has an Options button:

So I clicked it to see what options are available and noticed that the "Embarcadero Customer Experience Program" is opted-in by default:

Clicking the lick leads to the [Privacy Statement for the Embarcadero Customer Experience Program](https://www.embarcadero.com/CustomerExperienceProgram_en).

Make sure to read the terms and check if you agree with them as it includes broad permissions, including the right o share the collected information with partners (without identifying who they are).

I don’t mind a CEP program but I don’t like a default opt-in. Hiding a default opt-in behind an Options button is a bad thing IMO.

**/EDIT:** above screenshots are from the online/.exe ESD installer, the ISO installer shows the CEP checkbox on the first screen (as it should be):
