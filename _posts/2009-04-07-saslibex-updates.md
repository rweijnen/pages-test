I have found and tested some new functionalities which I will add to [SasLibEx](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2009/03/30/sending-ctrl-alt-del-simulate-sas-in-windows-vista/):

- Unlocking workstation without entering password
- Cancel UAC (User Account Control) request
- fully disable Ctrl-Alt-Del
- Cancel Ctrl-Alt-Del
- Switch between secure desktop (where the UAC prompt is) and the normal desktop.

Some people asked if SasLibEx works on x64 or Windows 7, the answer is yes. I tested on build 7000 of Windows 7 beta and also on Server 2008 x64.
