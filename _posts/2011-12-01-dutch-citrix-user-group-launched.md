[![Dutch Citrix User Group Logo](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image_thumb.png "DUCUG Logo")](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image.png)A while ago I was invited for a presentation at the [UK Citrix User Group](http://www.citrixug.org.uk/). I went there together with my colleague Ingmar Verheij and we had a great day there.

I was impressed with what I say there, a community that was very much alive and with good discussions. It was clear that the UK Citrix User Group was doing very well, thumbs up for their Steering Group!

So Ingmar and I wondered why there was no active Dutch Citrix User Group in The Netherlands. There had been an initiative in the past, the DUCUG so we decided to see if we could revive it.

We made contact with the original founders of the DUCUG and had a very pleasant meeting with them.

We formed a Steering Group, consisting of some excellent guys: Kees Baggerman, Wilco van Bragt, Edwin Houben, Jon Jager, Barry Schiffer, Ingmar Verheij and myself.

Today is the official start of the new DUCUG with the launch of the [DUCUG website](http://www.ducug.nl) and the announcement of our first, FREE event!

The first event is really a try-out, so we have limited seating available. Out of the persons who registered we will invite the people to join this first event. So [register](http://www.ducug.nl/) for the event on the DUCUG website today. We are regretting that we cannot invite everyone this time. But we are sure this try-out will be big success and we will organize larger events in the nearby future where we can facilitate more people.
