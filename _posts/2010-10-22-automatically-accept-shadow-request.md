When you request Shadow (Remote Control) of a Remote Desktop (Terminal Server) or Citrix session the user gets a Dialog where he can Accept or Deny the Shadow Request.

It looks something like this:

![ShadowRequest](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/shadowrequest.png)

It‚Äôs possible to change the default settings and remove the need for this permission but I think this is a bad idea since it violates the user‚Äôs privacy.

But sometimes it would be convenient to automatically accept, for instance for when a user is away or when you want to shadow a session that is ‚Äúyours‚Äù but runs under another account.

I wrote a tool to do just that üòÄ  
It‚Äôs a commandline tool that must be run in the target session (tip: use my [RunInSession](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2007/11/08/how-to-launch-a-process-in-a-terminal-session-2/) tool). When you launch it, it will ‚Äúlisten‚Äù in a console window:

[![ShadowAccept1](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/shadowaccept1-small.png)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/shadowaccept1.png)

When a Shadow Request appears it is automatically Accepted and this is logged in the Console Window:

As usual have fun with it!
