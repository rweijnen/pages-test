I often hear that people configure the Paging File (on Citrix or Terminal Servers) on a seperate volume but, the reasons is either performance or the chance that the Paging File might corrupt the volume.

However if at some point you would like to create a Memory Dump you must have a paging file on the boot volume.

For a Small memory dump you need at least 2MB Paging File on the Boot Volume but for a Full Memory Dump you need a Paging File that is sufficient to hold all the physical RAM plus 1 megabyte (MB).

Side Note: with the increasing ram of todayâ€™s servers, how long does it take for a full memory dump to be saved when you have lots of gigabytes?
