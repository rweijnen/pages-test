My hoster has had some problems with the simulatesas.com domain that I use for SasLibEx enquiries. If you have sent mail to ![mail](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mail-2.gif) that has not been answered I kindly request you to send it again.

I would also like to briefly tell you about an upcoming new release of SasLib, version 2.0. There is so much I would like to tell you about it but I will limit it to a few highlights here and save the rest for the upcoming website on [SimulateSAS.com](http://www.simulatesas.com).

- A new option to simulate Control-Alt-Delete with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only user permissions</span> (no need to be admin or even system).
- New Switch console function to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reconnect</span> closed RDP sessions for remote control.
- Supports Windows Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2.
- Support for Delphi 2010, C++ Builder 2010 and will support MS Visual C++ 2010 once it reaches RTM.
- Native x64 support.

I feel especially good about 2.0 because further improvements were made to the code, again some highlights:

- Full documentation of all functions, parameters and known possible errors.
- 80% of the code was rewritten from scratch.
- Uses techniques like [annotations](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/05/19/602077.aspx) to further reduce the chance of programing errors.
- Structured testing.
