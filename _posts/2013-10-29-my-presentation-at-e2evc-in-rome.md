[![image](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image_thumb.png "image")](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image.png)I will be presenting a session at E2EVC in Rome next weekend.

Recently I published an article on my blog that shows how to [run an executable of choice when the Citrix Receiver exits](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2013/09/24/run-a-process-when-citrix-receiver-exits/).

Using this example we will open the Citrix Receiver in Ida Pro and disassemble it.

Using public resources such as the Citrix Public Symbol Server we can analyze, understand and finally make the code more readable.

I will try to make this session not an “enter the matrix one” but one that could be considered as an intro into using Ida Pro for reverse engineering and app compat fixing.

Hope to see you all in Rome, my session is scheduled [Friday November 1 from 18.30 – 19.15](http://www.e2evc.com/home/portals/0/Locations/FCO/Agenda/13.%20App%20fixing%20with%20Ida%20Pro%20for%20beginners%20by%20Remko%20Weijnen%20Citrix%20CTP.ics). There will be room for questions so feel free to take your own Crapplication™ and ask about it after the session.

See you in Rome!
