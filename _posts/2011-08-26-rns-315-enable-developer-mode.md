![](http://www.myturbodiesel.com/images/a5/nav/rns315.jpg)I recently had some time to play with VCDS and a friend’s RNS 315 navigation. By default there is no test mode or hidden menu with extra features like on some other Volkswagen systems.

Using VCDS we can however (temporarily) enable the Developer mode.

To do this you need to go to Select Control Module:

Then select 37-Navigation:

Then select Adaptation:

Select Channel “Developer mode (temporary)” (Permanent is not accepted):

Select Enabled as New value and click Do It!

Now hold the Setup button on the RNS315 for about 20 seconds and you will enter Developer Mode:

Developer Mode has several sub menus, here are some screenshots:
