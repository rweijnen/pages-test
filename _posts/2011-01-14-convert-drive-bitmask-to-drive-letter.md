I was writing a test program that will perform some actions when a USB Memory Stick is inserted.

When this happens Windows send a Broadcast a [WM\_DEVICECHANGE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363480(VS.85).aspx) message.

The wParam member of this Message contains a (pointer to) a [DEV\_BROADCAST\_HDR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363246(VS.85).aspx) structure.

if the dbch\_devicetype member of this structure is of type DBT\_DEVTYP\_VOLUME then we can cast the structure to [DEV\_BROADCAST\_VOLUME](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363249(v=VS.85).aspx).

And finally the dbcv\_unitmask member of that structure returns a Bitmask containing the Drive Letter.

A fast and convenient method to convert this Bitmask to a Drive Letter (the first found) is the function below:
