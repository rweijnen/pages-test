I wrote [earlier](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2011/05/04/vw-rns-510-navigation-startup-pictures/) about the startup logo’s on the Volkswagen RNS 510 navigation.

Today I can finally tell you that I succeeded!   
I changed the startup logo to the logo from the MFD2 DVD as you can seen on this picture:

[![rns510_bootscreen_mfd2](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rns510_bootscreen_mfd2_thumb.jpg "rns510_bootscreen_mfd2")](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rns510_bootscreen_mfd2.jpg)

I hope to be able to tell you more about how it works in the near future because I need more testing since it works slightly different on Skoda and Seat firmware version.

PS: Even though the unit in the screenshot has a Skoda front, it’s actually running VW firmware version.
