A while ago I published a [patch for Windows 2003 Terminal Server](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2008/08/31/patch-windows-2003-terminal-server-to-allow-more-than-2-concurrent-sessions/) that allows more than 2 concurrent sessions in Remote Administration mode.

Today I publish the same patch but for Windows Server 2003 X64. The patched function (CRAPolicy::Logon) is the same as in the original patch.

The patch was tested with build 5.2.3790.3959, English language.

This patch uses a new patch engine which I described [here](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2008/12/09/new-universal-patch-method/). If you have tested the patch on a different language and/or build of termsrv.dll please report back if itâ€™s working.
