I did an unattended install of the Citrix WebInterface on a testmachine and it failed with error 258.

The logfile clearly indicates the reason:

> \[ ERROR \] com.citrix.wi.install.SetupErrorReporter: Error 258 occurred: ASP.NET 2.0 must be registered and enabled in Microsoft Internet Information Services before the Web Interface can be installed.

We can register ASP.NET in IIS with the [Aspnet\_regiis.exe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k6h9cz8h(VS.80).aspx "ASP.NET IIS Registration Tool (Aspnet_regiis.exe)") tool that comes with the .NET framework.

The commandline would be:

> aspnet\_regiis.exe -enable -ir

We do need to make sure we are using the proper version of the tool (x86 or x64), I did that in the Embedded Altiris Script:
