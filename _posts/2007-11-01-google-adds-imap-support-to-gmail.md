Google has added [imap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imap "Wikipedia.org -- Internet Message Access Protocol") support to GMail. This means you can use an e-mail client like Outlook (Express) to read your mail but you donâ€™t have to download and store them locally. Read more [here](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?ctx=gmail&hl=en&answer=75725). The Storage Limit has been raised to 4 GB (at time of writing 4569 MB)
