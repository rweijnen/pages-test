Citrix Receiver and StoreFront error messages are sometimes confusing or lacking details so I decided to make little blog notes about common issues when I see them. So without further ado here’s #1:

In Citrix Receiver I tried to logon remotely via NetScaler Gateway and got the following error message: “*Cannot get your apps from the store*”

<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3746" style="width: 310px">[![Cannot get your apps from the store](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899c6cbba7eb-300x169.png)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899c6cbba7eb.png)Citrix Receiver

</div>When using a browser to connect the error message was different:

<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3748" style="width: 310px">[![The connection to "XenApp - Server 2016 Desktop" failed with status (Unknown client error 1110)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899ccb55f5c2-300x102.png)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899ccb55f5c2.png)Desktop Viewer

</div>Using HTML5 (“Light Version”) it simply said: “*Citrix receiver cannot connect to the server*“:

<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3749" style="width: 310px">[![Citrix Receiver cannot connect to the server](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899cde1b70a9-300x232.png)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899cde1b70a9.png)Error

</div>Connecting to StoreFront directly from the internal network gave yet another error, either “Cannot complete your request” or just a wait cursor

<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3751" style="width: 310px">[![Cannot complete your request](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899cfb5716a7-300x135.png)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899cfb5716a7.png)Cannot complete your request

</div>In the Citrix Delivery Services EventLog I could see Event ID 9 Citrix Credential Wallet Service:

<div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3747" style="width: 310px">[![An unexpected error occurred retrieving the credentials. System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089 The given key was not present in the dictionary. at System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary`2.get_Item(TKey key) at Citrix.DeliveryServices.CredentialWallet.InMemory.InMemoryWallet.get_Item(Index index) at Citrix.DeliveryServices.CredentialWallet.Service.CredentialWalletService.Retrieve(Byte[] index)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899c776e0c75-300x210.png)](http://192.168.40.25:8081/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_5899c776e0c75.png)Event 9, Citrix Credential Wallet Service

</div>The cause? NetScaler is used to load balance the StoreFront servers and was set to Persistency SSLSESSION instead of SOURCEIP. To change this go to Traffic Management -&gt; Load Balancing -&gt; Virtual Servers, select the entry for StoreFront and click Edit.

In the Persistence Tab change from SSLSESSION to SOURCEIP and click OK, followed by Done (and save the running config).
