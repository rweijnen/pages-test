Just a quicky, I am little excited because my certifications are going well.

Last month I passed the final exam for [MCITP Enterprise Administrator](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcitp.aspx#tab2) and a few minutes agoI got a mail from Citrix confirming that I passed the beta exam for XenApp 6 which means I am certified ([CCA for XenApp 6](http://www.citrixtraining.com/courses/course_view.cfm/course_id:295/cgroup_id:26)).

I may now call myself: MCITP Enterprise Administrator, MCSE and MCSA + Messaging, MCDBA and CCA ðŸ˜›
