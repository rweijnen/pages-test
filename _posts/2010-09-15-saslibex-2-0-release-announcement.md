Today I can proudly announce the official release of SasLibEx 2.0 which will bring support for new compilers, a native x64 version and some exciting new features!

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Compilers:</span>**

SasLibEx 2.0 introduces support for Visual Studio 2010 (C++), RAD Studio 2010 (Delphi and C++ personalities) and the new RAD Studio XE (Delphi and C++).

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Native x64:</span>**

A separate native x64 version is available for Visual Studio 2005, 2008 or 2010 (C++).

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Features:</span>**

SasLibEx 2.0 introduces new unique features, the most important ones being:

- New method to simulate the Secure Attention Sequence (SAS aka Ctrl-Alt-Del) with **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">only user permissions</span>**.
- <div>New Switch console function to reconnect closed RDP sessions for remote control.</div>
- <div>SasLibEx could already Lock and Unlock (without credentials) the Desktop, now there is also a function to determine if a Desktop or Session is Locked.</div>
- <div>Log off any session from a service.</div>
- <div>Retrieve the user’s name from a service.</div>

Just like the old features, the new features do not require User Account Control to be enabled, nor does it require signing your executables.
