**About me**

My name (obviously) is Remko Weijnen, I work as an EUC Specialist at [Cloudhouse](http://www.cloudhouse.com/) and have my own company (Weijnen ICT Diensten).

However this blog is not related to my company or Cloudhouse but just a personal blog where I like to share whatever I find interesting..

In this blog I will talk about Desktop Virtualization, (Delphi) programming, reverse engineering, security and other things that I’m interested in.

In 2013 I was honoured with the Citrix Technology Professional (CTP) award which was renewed in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  
The CTP Program recognizes the contributions of individuals who have invested a significant amount of time and resources to become experts in Citrix products and solutions. The wealth of knowledge they have developed – and more importantly, openly shared – has proven invaluable to the Citrix technology community.

There are currently 50 CTP’s worldwide.

Currently I participate in 2 open source projects, the [Jedi Apilib project](http:// "http://jedi-apilib.sourceforge.net/") and the [Jedi Security library](http://jedi-apilib.sourceforge.net/).
