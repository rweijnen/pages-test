If you ever download software from [Microsoft’s Volume Licensing Site](https://licensing.microsoft.com "Microsoft Volume Licensing Site") you have probably seen that it uses the Akamai download manager. Sometimes your downloads get interrupted but how to restart the downloadmanager? There’s no entry in the startmenu and not even an icon on the desktop.

You can restart the downloadmanager though by creating a shortcut to “C:\\Windows\\DOWNLO~1\\CONFLICT.1\\Manager.exe”. Please notice the short directory name (~1).
