A few weeks ago I turned on my old [Commodore Amiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) A1200 which had been stored for 15 years or so.

The idea was that my kids can use it as a game computer but tonight I couldn’t resist and I played some of the old games.

Do you remember [International Karate+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Karate_%2B)?

It’s still a very nice game to play with excellent gameplay even though it seems that my Suzo Arcade joystick has had it’s best time (Luckily I have a 2nd one somewhere but I can’t find it).

I also noticed there is an online [flash based clone](http://ant.simianzombie.com/files/flashgames/ik/) of International Karate+.

It’s not’s as good as the real thing especially in the gameplay but it’s done very well.
