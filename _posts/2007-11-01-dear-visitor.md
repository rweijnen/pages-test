If this is your first visit, take your time and look around. Here are some things you might be looking for:

- [SasLibEx](http://www.simulatesas.com/blog/tag/saslibex/): a library that can simulate the Secure Attention Sequence (Ctrl-Alt-Del) but it can even unlock a workstation or session without entering or needing the userâ€™s credentials (and many more things).
- [Who locks my file](/blog/2011/01/03/cannot-access-files-but-need-the-origin/)?
- [Patch 32 bit Windows to use the full 4 GB (and even more) memory](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2009/06/23/patch-vistas-kernel-to-address-more-than-4-gb-of-memory/)
- Patch Terminal Server to allow more Concurrent Sessions: [2003](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2008/08/31/patch-windows-2003-terminal-server-to-allow-more-than-2-concurrent-sessions/), [Windows XP X64](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2008/12/19/windows-xp-x64-terminal-server-patch-part-1-mandatory/), [2003 X64](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2008/12/09/windows-2003-x64-terminal-server-patch/), [2008](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2008/10/21/patch-windows-2008-terminal-server-to-allow-more-than-2-concurrent-sessions/), [Vista](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2008/06/14/mutiple-concurrent-terminal-session-on-vista-sp1/)
- Some of my freeware tools such as [LaunchRDP](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2007/10/17/launch-rdp-from-commandline/), [RDP Password Encryption](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2007/10/18/how-rdp-passwords-are-encrypted/), [Active Directory Excel Addin](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2007/11/01/query-active-directory-from-excel/), [RDP Clipboard Fix](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2007/10/25/rdp-clipboard-fix/) (well this list can go on and on, see also the Downloads section).
