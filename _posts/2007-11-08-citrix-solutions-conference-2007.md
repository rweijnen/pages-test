Yesterday I attended the Citrix Solutions Conference in Antwerp. Brad Pedersen (Chief Architect and Senior Fellow at Citrix Systems) held an interesting speech about [The End User Experience](http://www.citrix-eventservice.com/et/citrix/et/e/2007/01/1/m/be/agenda/popup/the_end_user_experience.html). I liked especially liked the part about the history of Citrix and the early versions of their products like Wincredible and Winframe. Since Brad wrote the original code for Citrix and thus Terminal Server (the stuff that is in winsta.dll now) I hoped he could share some info with me on the undiscovered parts of winsta.dll. Unfortunately Brad could not do this because of a non disclosure agreement with Microsoft. He did tell me that Citrix is pushing Microsoft to make more Terminal Server API’s public. I presume that’s why Vista and Windows 2008 offer some new API’s which I wrote about [earlier](http://192.168.40.25:8081/2007/10/30/new-terminal-server-apis-in-vista-sp1).
